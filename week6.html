<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I had 3 exams, so those took up most of my time. I did approach Professor Emmett Witchel to discuss research for the first time, and sat in on his research group (as they discussed the Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) for about 20 minutes before I had to leave (for this class). I then attended the Atlassian talk later the same day and got some free pizza and free bonus quiz points. Additionally, I finally enrolled at the Austin VA Outpatient Clinic so that I now actually have medical coverage, and I participated in my first programming competition (though I didn't finish, and learned just how much I need to become familiar with if I want to be fast enough).
</p>
 
<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Exams are a big roadblock as usual. Additionally, it kind of sucks that I happen to have a class right in the middle of a research group that I'm invited to (and excites and interests me). I'm also still kind of adjusting to all the changes in my life from transferring to UT and getting involved in a dozen different things, though I think I'm getting there.
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I'm hopefully going to meet with Professor Witchel at some time when I won't have to run out 20 minutes in. Additionally, the test for this class is coming up, so I need to prepare for it. I'm also planning on going camping either this next weekend or the one after.
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Getting nervous about the test now, since I don't know what to expect and there are only two of them. If they're rehashes of the quizzes and lectures I think I should be just fine, but again, I don't know if that's the case. 
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	<a href = "https://www.regexpal.com/">Regex Pal</a> is an amazing tool for testing regular expressions and figuring out exactly what you need in order to pick out specific items from a body of text. It supports both javascript and perl standards, which covers most of bases for regex.
