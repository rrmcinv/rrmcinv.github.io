<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I got my Law School Admission Test (LSAT) results back: 179 out of 180, which puts me in the top 99.94% of LSAT test takers. In other words, out of the 52,000 or so law school applicants per year, I'm in the top 32 or so admission-test wise. Pretty cool, and good news for my Stanford aspirations. <br>
	I also, of course, took the test for this class, did a bunch of homework, studied quite a lot, and otherwise did a lot of schooling. I've also started reaching out to some people I met in the Navy who might be able to help me with getting admitted to Stanford Law.

<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Still working on those Letters of Recommendation, as well as trying to actually get a research task from Professor Witchel to do (he's incredibly busy and our appointments keep falling through). Oh, and I have the minor task of trying to 4.0 in a CS/math double major. Also, it turns out I'm not naturally brilliant at competitive programming - go figure, I might need to practice if I want to be any good (and I'm not entirely positive I do).
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Finally going to go camping. Presumably going to start working on project 3 in this class. Hopefully going to be able to get ahold of the Spring 2018 course catalog and do some serious planning. Absolutely NOT going to study for an OOP test.
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Still overall enjoying the abstract concepts taught in the book and in the papers more than the minutiae discussed in lecture (though sometimes those minutiae can be very interesting). I'm kind of excited to see what project 3 will be; I'm itching to program something significant, and I haven't really had the chance since the last project.
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I guess I'd like to mention that <a href = "https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">notepad++</a> is an editor that I find absolutely indispensable. It's got some rather powerful extensibility, and I find some of its features (like block highlighting and editing) to be invaluable. In some contexts I'm sure I'd prefer an IDE, but this little editor has carried me through quite a lot, and I love it to death.
