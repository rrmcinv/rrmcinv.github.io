<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	My partner and I put finishing touches on Project 3 and turned it in. I attended the UT Law Fair and met with representatives from Stanford Law School (my dream school, where I plan to pursue a joint MS in CS/JD). I also attended a Harvard Law info session (I might be able to pursue a join degree there), and met with some other schools (less chance of a joint degree, but can't hurt). In my free time, I completed messing with the SGX page fault microbenchmarks for my research project and I'm moving on to comparisons between native SGX and the Ryoan framework. Lastly, I've been studying for my next series of exams, which begins next week.

<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Probably a lack of time. Really I just want to do everything there is to do, and learn everything under all the suns in the universe, but life demands that I focus on a few goals at a time. It will be hard enough (and improbable enough) to get into this joint program, so I'm just going to focus exclusively on that for the next year or so. Oh, and if next week I can't get the classes I need, that will change my entire plan for the rest of my time in college.
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I'm moving to a new apartment, I have an exam on Thursday, and I register for classes on Thursday. Registering takes only a moment, but it's going to be rather severely impactful, and probably the most important thing I do this semester.
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Cruisin'. 
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	<a href = "https://www.interviewcake.com/">Interviewcake</a> is a pretty cool site that offers interview-programming practice courses. It DOES cost money to subscribe, but there's also a free trial course, and even if you purchase the full thing there's a more-than-reasonable refund policy (they'll supposedly refund you the full cost if you don't get the job you're trying for). All in all a pretty neat site.
