<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Most of my time was spent moving; I only had to trek across the same apartment complex, but it was still quite a time (and muscle) intensive process. I managed to register for the classes that I need next semester, and I'm on track even though it will be a brutal Spring. Additionally, I took a test in one of my classes, so I spent a bit of my time studying for it. Further, I worked on my research, managing to finally implement the research team's performance model into the benchmarks I wrote. Lastly, I worked with my partner on Project 4 in this class and managed to get a lot of it done.
</p>
 
<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Well, I've still got to finish moving; there's plenty of stuff to unpack still. Also, this coming Spring will be quite difficult - I'm taking two CS courses, two math courses, and a writing-intensive section of the "undergraduate signature course." Additionally, my research has become somewhat frustrating, as the results I keep getting are not what I expect. 
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Nothing particularly fun going on, I'm sorry to say. I've got two more exams, Project 4 to wrap up, more moving to do, and, as always, research.
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I'm very glad that we have an object-oriented project this time. It's a challenging puzzle to figure out how to do everyting without ever using a getter or setter, and certainly requires re-thinking the way I view programming, but it's definitely fun and interesting.
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	The "constexpr" keyword is great in c++, as it allows the use of compile-time evaluation of symbolic constants. This lets you use words instead of numbers in places where a normal "const" would be insufficient.
