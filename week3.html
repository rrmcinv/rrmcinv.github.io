<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	In addition to finishing Collatz, I finally took the LSAT. I also made some plans to visit Hamilton Pool next week, and helped out a little bit at Austin Pets Alive.
</p>
 
<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Well, now that the LSAT is done with, I've got to turn my attention to doing well in school. Mostly this involves making good grades (which seems to me like a harder proposition than it was at A&M), getting letters of recommendation, and seeing if I can't do some research.
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I've got a lot of classwork to catch up on due to the fact that I was neglecting it in order to prepare for the LSAT. I'm probably going to talk to a math advisor about double majoring (due to a number of reasons), and I've also got that Hamilton Pool trip scheduled. Oh, and Divinity Original Sin 2 came out, so I've got to find time for it at some point!
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Being called on is still terrifying. I was asked to answer some simple questions about priority queues, and despite the fact that I used to be a peer teacher for A&M's data structures and algorithms class, and in fact taught the reviews for the class (including all kinds of stuff about priorioty queues), my mind froze up and I acquitted myself poorly. It's fairly intense to be in Dr. Downing's headlights!
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	<a href ="www.cplusplus.com">www.cplusplus.com</a> is an absolutely excellent reference for STL items. It's saved my bacon a number of times, and while it's not exactly a great place to go to learn C++ from scratch, it's extremely useful for learning the interfaces for a lot of important objects.
