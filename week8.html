<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	My partner and I managed to finish project 3 in a fairly short time frame. I was finally assigned a project by Professor Witchel, and I'm now working with Tyler Hunt (one of his grad students) to create microbenchmarks for a hardware toolset that I find pretty cool (see #5). A lot of my time was spent reading and trying to understand the papers written on this project, and furthermore learning how to use the SDK I need to use to accomplish my tasks.
</p>
 
<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I need to learn a whole lot more about operating systems! Also, whether or not I'm able to get the classes I <b>need</b> to take this Spring will determine whether double majoring (or at least getting the BS) in math will be viable (and that's not even considering whether I'll be able to succeed in the courses!)
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Turn in Project 3. It's also my birthday on the 27th, and I have a meeting with Harvard Law School people on that day (hell of a birthday present).
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Free quizzes are great. The allocator project reminded me very much of my TAMU Operating Systems class, where we built a similar allocator (though using the "buddy system" and predefined block sizes).
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I guess I'm going to plug the stuff the project I'm working on is based off of. <a href = "https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/086.pdf">Intel's SGX</a> is a very cool hardware feature, present in all modern Intel chipsets, that provides some serious security features for untrusted computation. <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/witchel/pubs/hunt16osdi-ryoan.pdf">Ryoan</a> is a framework built by Tyler Hunt, Professor Emmett Witchel, and some other students here at UT. It takes advantage of SGX to create super-secure sandboxes within "enclaves" that protect data from not only the operating system, but even from the applications running within the enclaves and processing the data. It's a pretty neat idea, and we might start to see its applicablity to providers of software-as-a-service in the future.
