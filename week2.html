<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I studied for the LSAT, started to actually get used to the idea that I'm going to UT now, and wrestled a whole lot with the workflow for this class. I also got sick, though it was not unexpected, considering the fact that I have been introduced to a new campus during a period of high stress.
</p>
 
<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Illness and the LSAT are both major hurdles in my way. Fortunately, I should be able to get over both of them soon enough. 
</p>
<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	In addition to working on the project for this class, I'm taking the LSAT next Saturday, which has been demanding a lot of my attention. I also have a lot of the first homeworks for my classes due, so it will likely be a busy week.
</p>
<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	So far the quizzes are my least favorite part of the class. The time limit for the quizzes is very short, and I did not like having to try to figure out something that required a bit of creativity (whether mcl(b,e) = mcl(m,e)) in 60 seconds; I feel like in problems like that, with that time limit, if you choose to attempt to do the wrong thing (either prove or disprove), there's no time to attempt the other.
</p>
<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	There is a pretty cool organization out there called <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking</a>. They organize hackathons around the country, which are events where you go, alone or with a team, and try to make something cool in a single weekend. All kinds of companies will often be there, and it's a great way to network and learn new stuff.
