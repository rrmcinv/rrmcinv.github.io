The course starts slowly. If you're already familiar with C++, the first several weeks of class and two or three projects will probably be really easy for you: none of it requires knowing anything about object oriented programming, and you can get a good grade just writing in a pretty procedural way. <br>
However, the book is pretty good throughout the course, and will help to teach you OOP concepts. It's very removed from what Dr. Downing teaches in lecture, though, so you'll have to get through the reading on your own time and in your own way (it's worth it, though). <br>
The articles are a similar story; they have things worth learning. You don't have to agree with everything in them, but they provide interesting viewpoints and important concepts, usually presented by very accomplished professionals. Read them!<br>
After the first few weeks, the lectures get a lot more nitty-gritty, but also a lot more OOP oriented. The latter projects, too, require that you exercise some good OOP principles, and they can be fairly interesting to figure out - so don't slack thinking that the last projects will be the same as the first! <br>
There's a quiz at the start of effectively every single class, so do your readings!! He will draw from the book and the articles for some of the quiz questions, and the points add up. Also make sure that you really understand the material he went over, especially from the last lecture or two; that stuff WILL show up on the quiz, and the problems are usually fairly challenging. Don't slack!<br>
You also have to be prepared to be called on randomly at any point in class and required to answer questions he asks you. This is his way of lecturing. Pay attention during class or this will be real unpleasant for you. I freaked out the first time he called on me; he'll ask you about things you should know from other classes, but he'll also ask you to figure out material that he hasn't taught yet (because this is how he teaches it). It can be super difficult under pressure, out of nowhere, in the middle of class, but realize that he is not trying to embarrass you - it's just how he teaches (and it works; if you mess something up you won't ever forget the correct answer).<br>
Finally, the tests are a mixture of book readings, articles, and lecture. Half of the test (at least this semester) is multiple choice and half is coding. You'll be asked to really utilize the concepts that you've learned, so make sure you understand them thoroughly - beyond memorization, you need to know HOW to use them and WHY they are used that way.<br>
It's a good course, so if you're willing to put in some work, take it and stick with it, and remember that everything Dr. Downing does is to instruct.
