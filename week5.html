<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I put the finishing touches on Project 2 and submitted it. Additionally, I attended a linguistics talk on phraseology (as part of a requirement for a class I'm in), and found it to be somewhat less boring than I had feared. I've also been spending quite some time studying for exams, as I have 3 midterms next week. 
</p>
 
<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Exams!! I'm also having difficulty finding someone to research under who doesn't tell me "take a class with me first." Additionally, I finally confirmed that I can double major in math (and hashed out a doable schedule for it), but the idea is pretty daunting nonetheless.
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Exams. I'm planning to attend Monday's Atlassian talk (who can pass up free pizza and an easy quiz?), and I also might go camping over the weekend (if it's not cancelled due to life circumstances, which it's looking like it might be). Lastly, I was finally assigned a CS adviser, so I'm going to meet with them and clarify some things.
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I'm starting to enjoy the lectures more as we delve into some of the more interesting (and at times obscure) minutiae of the C++ language. The quizzes are still often difficult, and I wonder what the tests will be like.
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	<a href = "https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is a pretty cool website that has a bunch of interesting CS problems and challenges listed. Many of them are math based, and they scale in difficulty as you progress down the list. It's worth checking out if you have time and like to challenge yourself.
