<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	My partner and I put some very light finishing touches on Darwin (we managed to construct what I think is a pretty darn good object-oriented program with absolutely no real getters or setters). I also took two exams, finished moving into my new apartment, and made some progress on my research.
</p>
 
<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Research can be super frustrating! I feel like I'm making very simple errors, which, while leading to learning at every step, also feels awful sometimes. I also feel somewhat impatient for the next semester to begin, so I've got to exert some effort to keep focused on this one!
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	This will be the first week in a bit without anything "major" going on in my life, so I'm planning to focus on schoolwork/research as well as a bit of relaxation. I also expect to start Project 5 in this class (which is due on Thanksgiving day?!)
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I'm eager for the final project! It took a while, but things have finally gotten to the point that I feel like I'm learning how to apply OOP principles, and I sincerely hope that this last project affords me another opportunity to do so.
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	For gcc and g++, the flag -O0 will disable "any and all" compiler optimizations. This is, admittedly, not particularly desirable behavior in most circumstances, but I've been doing performance testing recently and knowing exactly how your code is actually going to be compiled can be extremely important in that case.
