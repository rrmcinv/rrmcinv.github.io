<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I started Project 5. I decided to do this one alone, as I've got a lot going on in my personal life and I really shouldn't need the points (though watch that come back and bite me when I get a 60 on the final). I also continue to spend what is probably an excessive amount of time on research (I think I spent 10 hours on Thursday). 
</p>
 
<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Professor Witchel has me working in assembly, measuring L1 and LL cache hits and misses, and doing a whole bunch of stuff that I have simply never done before, and it's eating up a ton of my time. It's also causing me a lot of stress, as he tends to start emailing me in the afternoons, which is about the time I finish working on school (I get up at 7am most days), so I'm solidly busy some nights until around 10pm. Hopefully it ends up worth it.
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I'm visiting my family for Thanksgiving. Hopefully it'll serve as a nice retreat from school for a while.
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Inheritance stuff starts to get pretty complicated. There are a lot of stupid rules and exceptions to keep track of, but I think it'll be OK.
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	You can write assembly inline in C using asm(). Even better, you can write "extended assembly", which means that you can use your C variables/symbols in the assembly, and control how it gets converted with detail but abstraction.
