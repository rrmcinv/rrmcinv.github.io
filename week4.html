<b> 1. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I found a partner and worked with him to finish most of the major strokes of the voting project. I also spent quite a lot of time reading King Lear, due to the fact that I have a test coming up for my British Literature class. Additionally, I visited Hamilton Pool for the first time (it was very nice but the water was so cold!), and I went to a volunteer orientation for the organization Code2College (see below).
</p>
 
<b> 2. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I got sick for the second time this semester, which is really irritating. My immune system is apparently not well equipped to deal with the plagues circulating around UT.
</p>

<b> 3. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	In addition to turning in my Voting project, I intend to finally make steps towards figuring out exactly what I need to do in order to secure some letters of recommendation here at UT, as well as to get involved in UT undergraduate research.
</p>

<b> 4. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	There is a whole lot of independent research to be done in this class, and somewhat of a disconnect between the lecture, the book, the assigned papers, and the projects. We used a custom class in the 2nd project, but I'm still waiting for something that will really demand a lot of OOP principles and practices.
</p>

<b> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	<a href = "https://code2college.org/">Code2College</a> is an organization that promotes STEM fields to underrepresented groups through education and mentorship. People with programming knowledge can volunteer there to teach highschool students how to code, as well as various business and leadership skills that will equip them for success. It's a really cool effort and definitely something worth looking into if anyone is interested in that sort of thing.
